Title:
 The Super Simple Health Pack.

Description:

 This 15 item basic asset pack is to fill that little pocket of items everyone needs for health recovery. 
 Easily adaptable for additional colors and other facets of your character's measurables. The pack
 includes red, blue and green texture set to get you started.  Recovery items are important for the 
 long haul!  
 
Install: 

 Just import the package to your project and your all set.  Your new assets wil be in a folder 
 labled 'the insanely basic health pack.'  No additional work required. 

How To Use It:

 Included in this package are some ready Prefabs for quick use. Each Prefab is ready for use with a 
 spinning animation in game. A second animation for wobbling is also included for a different kind 
 of spin. Drag and drop to insert. Sorry, these are just objects, you will need to add your own 
 scripting to make each object do what they need to do. (there's plenty of sample ones out there.)
